## Automating Domain Enumeration with Bloodhound

`Bloodhound` is a program that is used to enumerate AD environments. This program needs a harvester, that collects all the information of the AD, in this case we will use `SharpHound` . This harvester, has to be executed in a machine belonging to the domain, that means we need valid user credentials in order to use `BloodHound`.

To launch `Bloodhound` we will use the following commands:

```bash
neo4j console
```

```bash
bloodhound
```

As we have said, we need a harvester that collects information of the AD. To harvest this information, we will upload the `Sharphound.ps1` file to the target machine. Them we will use the following command to create the `.zip`file containing all the information of the AD:

```bash
Invoke-Bloodhound -Collection Method All
```

This will create a `.zip` in the current directory. We will move this file to the attackers machine and lastly we will import it to `Bloodhound`.
